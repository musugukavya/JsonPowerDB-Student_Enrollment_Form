# Student Enrollment Form with JsonPowerDB Integration

## Description
This project implements a Student Enrollment Form that stores data in the Student-Rel relation of the Student database. The form includes input fields such as Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, and Enrollment-Date. The primary key for this form is Roll No.

The form is designed to interact with JsonPowerDB, a high-performance NoSQL database that combines the simplicity of key-value stores with the flexibility of document databases.

## Benefits of using JsonPowerDB
- JsonPowerDB is easy to use and allows for faster development.
- It provides high performance and efficiency for data storage and retrieval.
- JsonPowerDB supports both key-value and document-based data models.
- It offers real-time data integration and analytics capabilities.
